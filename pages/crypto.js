      A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency
      designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that
      is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to
      uphold or maintain it.It is a decentralized system for verifying that the
      parties to a transaction have the money they claim to have, eliminating
      the need for traditional intermediaries, such as banks, when funds are
      being transferred between two entities.
      <br />
      Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is
      typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically
      use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency
      (CBDC).When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or
      issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When
      implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through
      distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a
      public financial transaction database.Traditional asset classes like
      currencies, commodities, and stocks, as well as macroeconomic factors,
      have modest exposures to cryptocurrency returns.

      Mining for proof-of-work cryptocurrencies requires enormous amounts of
      electricity and consequently comes with a large carbon
      footprint.Proof-of-work blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin,
      and Monero were estimated to have added between 3 million and 15 million
      tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere in the period from 1
      January 2016 to 30 June 2017. By November 2018, Bitcoin was estimated to
      have an annual energy consumption of 45.8TWh, generating 22.0 to 22.9
      million tonnes of CO2, rivalling nations like Jordan and Sri Lanka. By the
      end of 2021, Bitcoin was estimated to produce 65.4 million tonnes of CO2,
      as much as Greece,and consume between 91 and 177 terawatt-hours annually.
